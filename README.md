# Appscrip E-Commerce Project

This is a modern e-commerce web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation of an e-commerce platform with a focus on user experience and modern design principles. It features product listings, filtering capabilities, cart functionality, and responsive design for optimal viewing across devices.

### Key Features
- Responsive product grid layout
- Product filtering and sorting
- Shopping cart functionality
- User authentication
- Checkout process
- Modern UI with attention to accessibility

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load a new font family for netlify.
